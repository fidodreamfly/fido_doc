	<dt>FIDO Authenticator</dt>
	<dd><p>An authentication entity that meets the <abbr title="FIDO Alliance">FIDO Alliance</abbr>’s requirements 
	  and which has related metadata.</p>
	  <p>A FIDO Authenticator is responsible for user verification, and maintaining 
	    the cryptographic material required for the relying party authentication.</p>
	  <p>It is important to note that a FIDO Authenticator is only considered such for, 
	    and in relation to, its participation in <abbr title="FIDO Alliance">FIDO Alliance</abbr> protocols.  Because the 
	    <abbr title="FIDO Alliance">FIDO Alliance</abbr> aims to utilize a diversity of existing and future hardware, 
	    many devices used for FIDO may have other primary or secondary uses.  
	    To the extent that a device is used for non-FIDO purposes such as local 
	    operating system login or network login with non-FIDO protocols, it is not 
	    considered a FIDO Authenticator and its operation in such modes is <i>not</i> 
	    subject to <abbr title="FIDO Alliance">FIDO Alliance</abbr> guidelines or restrictions, including those related 
	    to security and privacy.</p>
	  <p>A FIDO Authenticator may be referred to as simply an authenticator 
	    or abbreviated as “authnr”.  Important distinctions in an authenticator’s 
	    capabilities and user experience may be experienced depending on whether 
	    it is a roaming or bound authenticator, and whether it is a first-factor, 
	    or second-factor authenticator.</p>
	  <p>It is assumed by registration assertion schemes that the authenticator has

	      <p>Note: In general, there is no implication that the
