 This document analyzes the security properties of the FIDO UAF and U2F families of
 protocols. Although a brief architectural summary is provided below, readers should familiarize
 themselves with the the FIDO Glossary of Terms [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-FIDOGlossary">FIDOGlossary</a></cite>] for definitions
 of terms used throughout. For technical details of various aspects of the architecture,
 readers should refer to the <abbr title="FIDO Alliance">FIDO Alliance</abbr> specifications in the Bibliography.

 Conceptually, FIDO involves a conversation between a computing environment controlled
 by a Relying Party and one controlled by the user to be authenticated.
 The Relying Party's environment consists conceptually of at least a web server and the
 server-side portions of a web application, plus a FIDO Server.
 The FIDO Server has a trust store, containing the (public) trust anchors for the attestation
 of FIDO Authenticators.
 The user's environment, referred to as the FIDO user device, consists of one or more
 FIDO Authenticators, a piece of software called the FIDO Client that is the endpoint for
 UAF and U2F conversations, and User Agent software. The User Agent software may
 be a browser hosting a web application delivered by the Relying Party, or it may be a
 standalone application delivered by the Relying Party. In either case, the FIDO Client,
 while a conceptually distinct entity, may actually be implemented in whole or part within
 the boundaries of the User Agent. 

 <section id="intended-audience">
  <h3 aria-level="2" role="heading" id="h3_intended-audience"><span class="secno">2.1 </span>Intended Audience</h3>
  This document assumes a technical audience that is proficient with security analysis of
  computing systems and network protocols as well as the specifics of the FIDO architecture
  and protocol families. It discusses the security goals, security measures, security
  assumptions and a series of threats to FIDO systems, including the user's computing
  environment, the Relying Party's computing environment, and the supply chain, including
  the vendors of FIDO components.

<section id="attack-classification">

 <!--OddPage--><h2 aria-level="1" role="heading" id="h2_attack-classification"><span class="secno">3. </span>Attack Classification</h2>
 We want to distinguish the following threat classes (all leading to the impersonation of the user):
 <ol>
   <li>Automated attacks focused on relying parties, which affect the user but cannot be prevented by the user</li>
   <li>Automated attacks which are performed once and lead to the ability to impersonate the user on an on-going basis without involving him or his device directly.</li>
   <li>Automated attacks which involve the user or his device for each successful impersonation.</li>
   <li>Automated attacks to sessions authenticated by the user.</li>
   <li>Not automatable attacks to the user or his device which are performed once and lead to the ability to impersonate the user on an on-going basis without involving him or his device directly.</li>
   <li>Not automatable attacks to the user or his device which involve the user or his device for each successful impersonation.</li>
 </ol>

 
 <figure id="AttackClasses">	  
   <img src="./img/fido-security-ref-attack-classes.png" onerror="./img/fido-security-ref-attack-classes.png" alt="Attack Classes">
   <figcaption>Fig. <span class="figno">2</span> <span class="fig-title">Attack Classes</span></figcaption>
 </figure>

 The first four attack classes are considered scalable as they are automated (or at least can be automated).
 The attack classes 5 and 6 are not automatable; they involve some kind of manual/physical interaction of the attacker with the user or his device.
 We will attribute the threats analyzed in this document with the related attack class (AC1 – AC6).
   <div class="note"><div class="note-title" aria-level="2" role="heading" id="h_note_1"><span>Note</span></div><ol class="">
     <li>FIDO UAF uses asymmetric cryptography to protect against this class of attacks.  This gives control back to the user, i.e. when using good random numbers, the user’s authenticator can make breaking the key as hard as the underlying factoring (in the case of RSA) or discrete logarithm (in the case of DSA or ECDSA) problem.</li>
     <li>Once counter-measures for this kind of attack are commonly in place, attackers will likely focus on another attack class.</li>
     <li>The numbers at the attack classes do not imply a feasibility ranking of the related attacks, e.g. it is not necessarily more difficult to perform (4) than it is to perform (3).</li>
     <li>Feasibility of attack class (1) cannot be influenced by the user at all.  This makes this attack class really bad.</li>
     <li>The concept of physical security (i.e. “protect your Authenticator from being stolen”), related to attack classes (5) and (6) is much better internalized by users than the concept of logical security, related to attack classes (2), (3) and (4).</li>
     <li>In order to protect against misuse of authenticated sessions (e.g. MITB attacks), the FIDO Authenticator must support the concept of transaction confirmation and the relying party must use it.</li>
     <li>For an attacker to succeed, any attack class is sufficient.</li>
</ol></div>

<section id="uaf-security-goals">
 <!--OddPage--><h2 aria-level="1" role="heading" id="h2_uaf-security-goals"><span class="secno">4. </span>UAF Security Goals</h2>
 In this section the specific security goals of UAF are described.
 The FIDO UAF protocol [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-UAFProtocol">UAFProtocol</a></cite>] supports a variety of different FIDO Authenticators. Even though the
 security of those authenticators varies, the UAF protocol and the FIDO Server should
 provide a very high level of security - at least on a conceptual level. In reality it might require
 a FIDO Authenticator with a high security level in order to fully leverage the UAF
 security strength.
<div class="note"><div class="note-title" aria-level="2" role="heading" id="h_note_2"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">In certain environments the overall security of the 
  explicit authentication (as provided by FIDO) is less important, as it
  might be supplemented with a high degree of implicit authentication or 
  the application doesn’t even require a high
  level of authentication strength.</p></div>

 The FIDO U2F protocol [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-U2FOverview">U2FOverview</a></cite>] supports a more constrained set of Authenticator capabilities. It
 shares the same security goals as UAF, with the exception of [SG-14] Transaction Non-
 Repudiation.
 The UAF protocol has the following security goals:
 <dl> 
   <dt>[SG-1]</dt>
   <dd> Strong User Authentication: Authenticate (i.e. recognize) a user and/or a device
     to a relying party with high (cryptographic) strength.</dd>
   <dt>[SG-2]</dt>
   <dd>   Credential Guessing Resilience: Provide robust protection against eavesdroppers,
     e.g. <i>be resilient to physical observation, resilient to targeted impersonation, resilient
     to throttled and unthrottled guessing.</i>
   </dd>
   <dt>[SG-3]</dt>
   <dd>Credential Disclosure Resilience: Be <i>resilient to phishing attacks</i> and real-time
     phishing attack, including resilience to online attacks by adversaries able to actively manipulate
     network traffic.

  Independent of any particular implementation, the UAF protocol assumes some assets
  to be present and to be protected.
  <ol>
    <li>Cryptographic Authentication Key. Typically keys in FIDO are unique for each tuple
      of (relying party, user account, authenticator).</li>
    <li>Cryptographic Authentication Key Reference. This is the cryptographic material
      stored at the relying party and used to uniquely verify the Cryptographic Authentication
      Key, typically the public portion of an asymmetric key pair.</li>
    <li>Authenticator Attestation Key(as stored in each authenticator). This should only
      be usable to attest a Cryptographic Authentication Key and the type and manufacturing
      batch of an Authenticator. Attestation keys and certificates are shared
      by a large number of authenticators in a device class from a given vendor in order
      to prevent their becoming a linkable identifier across relying parties. Authenticator 
      attestation certificates may be self-signed, or signed by an authority key
      controlled by the vendor.</li>
    <li>Authenticator Attestation Authority Key. An authenticator vendor may elect to
      sign authenticator attestation certificates with a per-vendor certificate authority
      key.</li>
    <li>Authenticator Attestation Authority Certificate. Contained in the initial/default trust
      store as part of the FIDO Server and contained in the active trust store maintained
      by each relying party.</li>
    <li>Active Trust Store. Contains all trusted attestation master certificates for a given
      FIDO server.</li>
    <li>All data items suitable for uniquely identifying the authenticator across relying
      parties. An attack on those would break the non-linkability security goal.</li>
    <li>Private key of Relying Party TLS server certificate.</li>
    <li>TLS root certificate trust store for the user's browser/app.</li>

 <!--OddPage--><h2 aria-level="1" role="heading" id="h2_uaf-security-assumptions"><span class="secno">6. </span>UAF Security Assumptions</h2>
 Today’s computer systems and cryptographic algorithms are not provably secure. In this
 section we list the security assumptions, i.e. assumptions on security provided by other
 components. A violation of any of these assumptions will prevent reliable achievement
 of the Security Goals.

 <dl>
   <dt>[SA-1]</dt>
   <dd>The cryptographic algorithms and parameters (key size, mode, output length,
     etc.) in use are not subject to unknown weaknesses that make them unfit for their purpose
     in encrypting, digitally signing, and authenticating messages.
   </dd>
   <dt>[SA-2]</dt>
   <dd>Operating system privilege separation mechanisms relied up on by the software
     modules involved in a FIDO operation on the user device perform as advertised. E.g.
     boundaries between user and kernel mode, between user accounts, and between applications
     (where applicable) are securely enforced and security principals can be mutually,
     securely identifiable.
   </dd>
   <dt>[SA-3]</dt>
   <dd>Applications on the user device are able to establish secure channels that provide
     trustworthy server authentication, and confidentiality and integrity for messages
     (e.g., through TLS).
   </dd>
   <dt>[SA-4]</dt>
   <dd> The secure display implementation is protected against spoofing and tampering.
   </dd>
   <dt>[SA-5]</dt>
   <dd> The computing environment on the FIDO user device and the and applications
     involved in a FIDO operation act as trustworthy agents of the user.
   </dd>
   <dt>[SA-6]</dt>
   <dd> The inherent value of a cryptographic key resides in the confidence it imparts,
     and this commodity decays with the passage of time, irrespective of any compromise
     event. As a result the effective assurance level of authenticators will be reduced over
     time.
   </dd>
   <dt>[SA-7]</dt>
   <dd>The computing resources at the Relying Party involved in processing a FIDO operation
     act as trustworthy agents of the Relying Party.
   </dd>
 </dl>

 <section id="discussion">
  <h3 aria-level="2" role="heading" id="h3_discussion"><span class="secno">6.1 </span>Discussion</h3>
  With regard to [SA-5] and malicious computation on the FIDO user's device, only very
  limited guarantees can be made within the scope of these assumptions. Malicious code
  privileged at the level of the trusted computing base can always violate [SA-2] and [SA-
  3]. Malicious code privileged at the level of the user's account in traditional multi-user
  environments will also likely be able to violate [SA-3].

  <p>FIDO can also provide only limited protections when a user chooses to deliberately violate
  [SA-5], e.g. by roaming a USB authenticator to an untrusted system like a kiosk, or
  by granting permissions to access all authentication keys to a malicious app in a mobile
  environment.  Transaction Confirmation can be used as a method to protect against compromised 
  FIDO user devices.

  </p><p>In to components such as the FIDO Client, Server, Authenticators and the mix of software
  and hardware modules they are comprised of, the end-to-end security goals also
  depend on correct implementation and adherence to FIDO security guidance by other
  participating components, including web browsers and relying party applications. Some
  configurations and uses may not be able to meet all security goals. For example, authenticators
  may lack a secure display, they may be composed only of unattestable software
  components, they may be deliberately designed to roam between untrusted operating
  environments, and some operating environments may not provide all necessary
  security primitives (e.g., secure IPC, application isolation, modern TLS implementations,
  etc.)

   FIDO takes as a base assumption that [SA-3] applications on the user device are able
   to establish secure channels that provide trustworthy server authentication, and confidentiality
   and integrity for messages. e.g. through TLS. [T-1.2.4] Discusses some consequences
   of violations of this assumption due to implementation errors in a browser or
   client application, but other threats exist in different layers.

	    TLS connections. The client trusts this device, but the connection between
	    the user and FIDO server is no longer end-to-end secure.
	    <p><b>Consequences:</b> Any such proxies introduce a new party into the protocol. 
	      If this party is untrustworthy, consequences may be as for [T-1.2.4]
	    </p><p><b>Mitigations:</b> Mitigations for [T-1.2.4] apply, except that the proxy 
	      is considered trusted by the client, so certain methods of [SM-12] Channel Binding 
	      may indicate a compromised channel even in the absence of an attack. Servers should use multiple
	      methods and adjust their risk scoring appropriately. A trustworthy client that reports
	      a server certificate that is unknown to the server and does not chain to a
	      public root may indicate a client behind such a proxy. A client reporting a server
	      certificate that is unknown to the server but validates for the server's identity according
	      to commonly used public trust roots is more likely to indicate [T-3.1.2]

	    In the traditional username/password world, this allows the adversary to intercept the username

	      are used. 
	    </p><p><b>Mitigations:</b> 
	      In the case of channelBinding [SM-12], the FIDO server will detect the MITM in the 
	      TLS channel by comparing the channel binding information provided by the client 
	      and the channel binding information retrieved locally by the server.
	      </p><p>In the case of transaction confirmation [SM-10], the user verifies and approves 
		a particular transaction. The adversary could modify the transaction before approval.  
		This would lead to rejection by the user.  
		Alternatively, the adversary could modify the transaction after approval.  
		This will break the signature in the transaction confirmation response.  The FIDO Server
